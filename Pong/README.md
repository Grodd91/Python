# Pong-Game
Pong
Pong is a classic arcade game that tests your hand-eye coordination and reflexes. The goal of the game is to bounce a ball back and forth between two paddles, trying to prevent it from falling off the bottom of the screen. The first player to reach a certain number of points wins the game.

Gameplay
The game is played with two paddles and a ball. Each player controls one paddle, and the ball moves back and forth across the screen. The paddles are moved up and down to bounce the ball back to the other player.

If a player fails to hit the ball with their paddle, their opponent scores a point. The first player to reach a predetermined number of points wins the game.

Controls
Player 1: W to move the paddle up, S to move the paddle down
Player 2: Up arrow key to move the paddle up, Down arrow key to move the paddle down
