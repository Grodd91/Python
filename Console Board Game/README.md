# Console Board Game

A simple console-based board game written in Python. The player navigates through the board, attempting to reach the goal while avoiding obstacles. The game utilizes animation to provide smooth representation of player movement.

## Instructions

1. Run the program by executing the `game.py` file in your Python environment.

2. Upon starting the game, the board will be displayed in the console along with instructions.

3. The player uses the `up`, `down`, `left`, and `right` keys to move around the board in the upward, downward, leftward, and rightward directions respectively.

4. The goal of the player is to reach the goal (marked with the letter "G") without hitting obstacles (marked with the letter "O").

5. Upon reaching the goal, the player earns a point, and the board is updated, generating a new goal.

6. The game ends when the player hits an obstacle.
