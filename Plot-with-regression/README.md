# Scatter Plot with Regression Line

This program is written in Python and utilizes the matplotlib library to generate scatter plots with a fitted regression line.

## Installation

Before running the program, make sure you have the matplotlib library installed. You can install it using the following command: pip install matplotlib


## Usage

1. Open the `plot_with_regression.py` file in your code editor.

2. In the "Data for the plot" section, you can modify the values of the `x` and `y` arrays to customize the data used for generating the scatter plot.

3. If desired, you can adjust the configuration of the line plot and scatter plot with the regression line by modifying the relevant parameters.

4. Run the program, and two plots will be displayed: a line plot and a scatter plot with the fitted regression line.

## Example

The default data for the plot is:
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

If you want to see how the program behaves with different data, you can change the values of `x` and `y` to, for example:
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib library
