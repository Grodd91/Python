Telegram Group Member Adder
This Python program allows you to add members from one Telegram group to another Telegram group using the Telebot library.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Telebot library (pip install pyTelegramBotAPI)
Setup
Create a new Telegram bot by following the Telegram Bot API instructions. Make sure to save your API token somewhere secure.
Create two Telegram groups - a source group and a target group - and note their group IDs. You can find the group ID by adding the group to a Telegram channel and using the getFullChat method in the Telegram Bot API to retrieve the chat ID.
Clone this repository or download the add_members.py file.
Open the add_members.py file in a text editor and replace YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE with your actual Telegram API token. Also replace source_group_id and target_group_id variables with the actual IDs of your source and target groups, respectively.
Install the required Telebot library by running pip install pyTelegramBotAPI in your command line.
Usage
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the add_members.py file is located.
Run the add_members.py file by typing python add_members.py in the command line and pressing Enter.
The program will retrieve a list of members from the source group and add them to the target group. If a member cannot be added to the target group for any reason, an error message will be printed to the console.
