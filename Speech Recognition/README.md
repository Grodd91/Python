# Speech Recognition Program


## Description

This Python program utilizes the `speech_recognition` library to capture audio from the microphone and perform speech recognition in the English language.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have a functioning microphone connected to your computer.

3. Run the `speech_recognition.py` script using Python:

    ```
    python speech_recognition.py
    ```

4. Speak into the microphone when prompted. The program will attempt to recognize your speech and display the recognized text.

## Dependencies

- [speech_recognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/): A Python library for speech recognition.

## Notes

- The quality of speech recognition may vary based on factors such as accent, tone, and microphone quality.

- Keep in mind that speech recognition services rely on external APIs and may have usage limitations or require an internet connection.

- The program defaults to using the Google Web Speech API for English (en-US) recognition. You can customize the code to recognize other languages or utilize different recognition engines.
