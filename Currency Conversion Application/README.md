Currency Conversion Application
This is a simple Python application that converts currency using an API from CurrencyScoop.

Installation
To use the application, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You also need to obtain an API key from CurrencyScoop and add it to the api_key variable in the convert_currency function.

Then you can run the application by executing the convert.py file in your command prompt or terminal.

Usage
When you run the application, it will ask you to enter the amount to convert, the currency to convert from, and the currency to convert to. After you enter the required information, the application will call the CurrencyScoop API and display the converted amount.

Dependencies
The application uses the requests library to make HTTP requests to the CurrencyScoop API. You can install the library using pip by running the following command:
