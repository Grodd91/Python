# Linear Regression with TensorFlow

This is a simple program that demonstrates how to create, train, and use a linear regression model using the TensorFlow library. It generates training data, trains the model, plots the data and regression line, and performs predictions for new data points.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (you can install it using `pip install tensorflow`)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the program using the following command:

`python main.py`

4. The program will generate training data, train the linear regression model, plot the training data and regression line, and perform predictions for new data points.

## Program Overview

The program does the following:

- Generates random training data.
- Creates a linear regression model using TensorFlow's `Sequential` API.
- Compiles the model with the specified optimizer and loss function.
- Trains the model on the training data.
- Displays the learned weights and bias of the model.
- Plots the training data points and the regression line.
- Performs predictions for new data points.

## Customization

You can customize the program by modifying the parameters in the code, such as the number of training epochs, the learning rate, and the number of training data points.
