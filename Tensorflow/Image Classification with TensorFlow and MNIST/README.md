# Image Classification with TensorFlow and MNIST

This is a simple program that demonstrates how to create, train, and evaluate a neural network model for image classification using the TensorFlow library and the MNIST dataset. It preprocesses the data, creates a neural network model, trains it, evaluates its performance, and makes sample predictions.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (you can install it using `pip install tensorflow`)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the program using the following command:

  `python image_classification.py`

4. The program will load the MNIST dataset, preprocess the data, create and train the neural network model, evaluate its performance, and display sample predictions.

## Program Overview

The program does the following:

- Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset.
- Creates a neural network model using TensorFlow's `Sequential` API.
- Compiles the model with the specified optimizer and loss function.
- Trains the model on the training data.
- Evaluates the model's performance on the test data.
- Makes predictions for test data and displays sample predictions.

## Customization

You can customize the program by modifying the model architecture, training parameters, and visualization options in the code.
