# File and Folder Renamer

This Python program is designed to automatically rename files in a folder and convert folders into files. The program iterates through all the files and folders in the directory where it is located and assigns them new names.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need to have Python 3 interpreter installed. There are no additional dependencies required.

## Usage

1. Place the Python code file in the folder where you want to rename files and convert folders into files.

2. Run the program by executing the Python file. The program will automatically retrieve the path of the current directory where it is located.

3. The program will iterate through all the files and folders in the current directory and its subdirectories.

4. Files will be renamed to "file1", "file2", "file3", and so on, while folders will be converted into files with the same names.

## Note

Exercise caution when using this program as renaming files and converting folders into files can impact the folder structure and potentially result in data loss.

Ensure that you have a backup of your files before running the program to avoid any data loss.
