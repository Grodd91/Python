Automated Web Task
This is a Python program that automates a specific task on a website using the Selenium library and a headless Chrome browser.

Prerequisites
Before running the program, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3
Selenium library
Chrome browser
ChromeDriver

You can install the Selenium library by running the following command: pip install selenium

Make sure you have Chrome browser installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: Google Chrome

You also need to download ChromeDriver, which is the WebDriver used by Selenium to control the Chrome browser. You can download it from the ChromeDriver official website: ChromeDriver

Make sure to place the downloaded ChromeDriver executable in the same directory as the Python script.

Configuration
Open the Python script in a text editor and modify the following variables according to your needs:

username: Enter your username for the website.
password: Enter your password for the website.
receiver: Enter the recipient of the message.
message: Enter the content of the message.
Running the Program
To run the program, execute the following command in the terminal: python AutoWebTask.py
The program will launch a headless Chrome browser, perform the specified task (login, send a message), and then log out. The output will be displayed in the terminal.

Notes

The program uses a headless Chrome browser by default, which means the browser will run without a graphical interface. If you want to see the browser window during the execution, you can remove the --headless option from the options variable in the Python script.
Make sure to keep your Chrome browser and ChromeDriver up to date to ensure compatibility.
Customize the program according to your specific website by modifying the URLs, element IDs, and other relevant information in the Python script.
